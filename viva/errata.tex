\e p2, f1.1, l14: \& should be \&\&
\e p2: The discussion assumes implicitly that indices are over 
  nonnegative integers.
\e p2: ``this proof''---not clear that I talk about invariant's proof
\e p2: ``can be rephrased as follows'' should be ``is''
\e p5: Might need to add {\tt\char`\\null} after C.
\e p6: The core of hol provers is {\it supposed\/} to be small.
