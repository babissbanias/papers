\centerline{\bf Errata}\bigskip

\e p2, f1.1, l14: \& should be \&\&
\e p2: The discussion assumes implicitly that indices are over 
  nonnegative integers.
\e p2: ``this proof''---not clear that I talk about invariant's proof
\e p2: ``can be rephrased as follows'' should be ``is''
\e p5: Might need to add {\tt\char`\\null} after C.
\e p6: The core of hol provers is {\it supposed\/} to be small.
\e p7: ``that was exceptions'' should be ``that has exceptions''
\e p12: ``variable'' on lhs should be ``variable-declaration''
\e p13, f2.5: the rule [asgn] should {\it not\/} handle parallel assignments
\e p13: ``$1$, $2$, $3$ \dots'' should be ``$1$, $2$, $3$, \dots''
\e p19: ``log file'' should be ``{\bf l}og {\bf f}ile''
\e p19: ``The result of the whole run is'' should be ``FreeBoogie prints''
\e p21: ``all transformations in FreeBoogie, except loop handling,''
  should be ``all transformations in FreeBoogie are complete, except
  loop handling.''
\e p22, f3.4: Core Boogie does {\it not\/} have parallel assignments.
\e p23, f3.5: ``text'' should be ``{\sl text\/}''
\e p23: ``between generated classes'' should be ``in the generated code''
\e p24: ``Terminal classess, those that have no subclass declared in the
  abstract grammar'' should be ``Terminal classes, which are those without
  subclasses''. Also, remove ``that initializes those fields''.
\e p27: ``The initial call $u_1.u_1(u_2,\ldots,u_n)$''
  should be ``The initial call $u_1.m_1(u_2,\ldots,u_n)$''
\e p30: ``reference-paths'' should be ``reference-path''
\e p30: after ``safeguard against bugs'' add ``in FreeBoogie''
\e p34: ``$1$, $2$, $3$, $\ldots$'' appears with wrong commas twice
\e p35: ``all interpretations'' should be ``all models'', twice (I think!)
\e p38: ``It if then'' should be ``It is then''
\e p45: ``another possible source'' should be ``another source''
\e p47, d13: The definition of an optimization problem is overly complicated.
  It is enough to define a cost function $c:L\times L\to\Re_+$. A solution~$y$
  for an input~$x$ is feasible when $c(x,y)$ is finite.
\e p48 onwards: ``MINS'' should be ``mins''; ``LIS'' should be ``lis''

\e p58: After Theorem 1 I should say what $E$~is.
\e p63: Remove ``when $c(x)$ is not a copy node''.

  search space''

\e p73, e5.20: There is a $b_x$ missing in the second branch.
\e p74, e5.22: The typesetting of the range of $\land$ is messed up.
\e p75: ``The set {\it bs\/} $[\,\ldots\,]$ hash-consing.'' should be ``Hence, the
  hash-table that implements the set {\it bs\/} used by method~{\it Pre} may
  use reference equality.''
\e p75: ``the call ${\it And}(\{p,\bot\})$ returns~$p$'' should be
  ``the call ${\it And}(\{p,\top\})$ returns~$p$''
\e p88: ``The search concludes and ${\it vc}_{\rm sp}$ is declared valid.''
  should be ``The prover concludes that ${\it vc}_{\rm sp}$ is valid.''

\e p101: ``so proving time is'' should be ``so the proving time is'' 
\e p102: ``The main drawback is the lack of any guarantees that pruning
  reduces the query size when it is possible.'' should be ``The main
  drawback is the lack of substantial evidence that the particular 
  pruning method proposed in Section~6.3 does indeed reduce the size
  of typical queries.''
\e p108: ``smoke testing''. should be ``smoke testing.'' (quotes included!)
\e p110: ``depends only on nodes~$y$ that can reach node~$x$'' should be
  ``depends only on nodes~$x$ that can reach node~$y$''

  corresponding to some other node~$y'$ that is reachable from~$y$''
\e p110: ``If the only predecessor of node~$y$ is a blocker, then node~$x$
  is semantically unreachable,'' should be ``A node is semantically
  unreachable if all its predecessors are blockers,''. Also, I should
  explain that $x$~is a blocker if and only if $|\lnot b_x|$ holds.
\e p114: ``it is possible, for each white node~$y$ to find'' should be
  ``it is possible, for each white node~$y$, to find''
\e p114: ``whenever white node~$y$ is'' should be ``whenever the white
  node~$y$ is''
\e p115: ``it may make disconnect'' should be ``it may disconnect''
\e p116: ``first action paint the given'' should be ``first action paints
  the given''
\e p116: ``$p\lg p+(1-p)\lg(1-p)$'' should be ``$-p\lg p-(1-p)\lg(1-p)$''
\e p116: ``says that we should always inquire'' should be ``says that Bob
  should always inquire''
