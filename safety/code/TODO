- BUG: When edge a->b is split into a->I, I->b, I->error, there should also
  be a return edge I->a that contains the negated guards of I->b. IOW, you
  need to go back to state a if arguments match but not the return value.
  This implies we need a guard that says "NOT equal to this value".
  (e.g., examples/order.j fails with seed 673 because of this bug)
- cleanup code
- desugar properties into statements
- add tracing of execution
- cleanup code
- statement to havoc all (use as default body) -- deallocate all reachable heap
- pretty-printer for AST
- cleanup code

notes (low priority todos):
- symbolic execution
- translations
  - tppl -> coreStarIL
  - tppl -> Boogie
  - Java bytecode <-> tppl
  - NOTE: Boogie and coreStarIL are not executable in general, so can't be
    translated into tppl or bytecode.
- more examples
- it's very ugly that referring to fields and referring to methods is different
  - field  -- "this" is prohibited
  - this.method() -- "this" is required
- pure expressions are fine and nice, but it's rather annoying
  to not have function calls in expression; can I allow them as
  syntactic sugar?
- tc should reject name clashes
- better line number info for these errors
  - wrong return type
- property check: warn when variables are not used
