  - tppl -> Boogie

- more examples
- it's very ugly that referring to fields and referring to methods is different
  - field  -- "this" is prohibited
  - this.method() -- "this" is required
- pure expressions are fine and nice, but it's rather annoying
  to not have function calls in expression; can I allow them as
  syntactic sugar?
- tc should reject name clashes
- better line number info for these errors
  - wrong return type
- property check: warn when variables are not used
