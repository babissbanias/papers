- desugar
  - ... into two types of edges (call and return)
- interpret automaton
- cleanup code
- desugar properties into statements
- statement to havoc all (use as default body) -- deallocate all reachable heap
- pretty-printer for AST
- cleanup code
- generate coreStarIL
- ...

notes (low priority todos):
 - more examples
 - it's very ugly that referring to fields and referring to methods is different
    - field  -- "this" is prohibited
    - this.method() -- "this" is required
 - tc should reject name clashes
 - better line number info for these errors
    - wrong return type
 - pure expressions are fine and nice, but it's rather annoying
   to not have function calls in expression; can I allow them as
   syntactic sugar?
 - Generate this language from Java bytecode? It should be easy with ASM.
 - Generate Boogie from this language.
 - property check: warn when variables are not used
