- finish examples/bierhof2 (add literals)
- more examples
- example automaton
- parser for automatons
- ast for automatons
- TC for automatons
- interpreter with automata
- ...

notes (low priority todos):
 - statement to havoc all (use as default body)
 - tc should reject name clashes
 - allow 'var x' without type
 - better line number info for these errors
    - wrong return type
 - comments should be treated as ws by indentation grouping
 - pure expressions are fine and nice, but it's rather annoying
   to not have function calls in expression; can I allow them as
   syntactic sugar?
